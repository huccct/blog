### I. Up and Down

After a month of language learning, my overall English level hasn't significantly improved. The program mainly helps you adjust and teaches you some academic English, serving as a transition. However, for someone like me with a weak English foundation, it's truly not easy. Even if I listen attentively, I might only understand 70%. Even if I study hard, I might only achieve half of what others do. But when I think about it, this has been the case throughout my 20+ years of studying and living.

I accept my mediocrity and strive to do my best. I think as long as I don't let myself have regrets, that's good enough.

### II. Don't worry about what hasn't happened yet

Don't be anxious about things that haven't happened yet. However, this is something most people, including myself, find hard to do. If you want to adjust this, you can actually try some meditation and work hard to control it. I think this is very important, otherwise it will leave you feeling drained of energy, and this will impact many things you need to do in the future

### III. Do what you want to doÔºÅ

Everyone may have many attachments in life. If your economic foundation is relatively okay, you must choose to do what you like. This way, you are more likely to be relatively successful and happy.

Each stage of life may have different pursuits. For undergraduates, what may be important is to explore and enjoy this university time, this youthful period.

For graduate students, they may think more about the future and consider finances. The focus of each stage of life is different. But who knows what will happen in the future? Enjoy the present and do what you want to do.

### IV. Hope Everyone happy
