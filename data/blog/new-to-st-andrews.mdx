### I. Flight🛬

When I arrived at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport, I felt like it marked the beginning of a new stage in my life. I'm not sure if I will achieve everything I want, but I'm ready to see what the future holds.

Thank you to all my friends for their best wishes, and a special thanks to Tong for seeing me off at Beijing Capital Airport. Your support means the world to me.

After a long flight, we finally touched down at Edinburgh Airport.

We were all very tired, but everything felt fresh and interesting because we had arrived in a new country.

### II. Arrived at JBH🏠

We stayed in Edinburgh for about two hours waiting for our luggage. All the other passengers were foreigners to us, but we realized that now, we were too. After that, we spent another 1.15 hours traveling to our accommodation, admiring the beautiful landscapes of St. Andrews along the way.

Everything here is so calm and relaxing. You can feel the tranquility in the air.

### III. Feel some stress🗻

This week, we started our pre-sessional course, and I’m feeling a bit anxious. Everyone seems so cool and confident, but I feel a little out of place. I really want to improve, so I know I need to work hard—really hard.

To get better, I’ll need to repeat, repeat, and repeat to practice. In this new English-speaking environment, it will take some time to adjust to everything. However, all the teachers and people I’ve met are very kind. When you walk down the street, everyone smiles at you and says hello—it’s such a polite and welcoming behavior.

### IV. Just Do It 🚀

Often, we think a lot but do very little. The key is to take action—just do it, and everything will improve. Whether it’s going to the gym to exercise or meditating to enhance your focus, taking consistent action is what makes the difference.

The key to success in life is to `KEEP GOING`. This is my reminder to myself.

Smile and good night!
